Follow these instructions and provide an appropriate response.\n        # TASK:\n        Create a SQL query that solves the given question using the provided database schema. Use standard SQLite syntax.\n\n        # CONTEXT:\n        Database Schema:\nCREATE TABLE container_ships (ship_id INT, ship_name VARCHAR(255), ship_builder VARCHAR(255), year INT, container_type VARCHAR(255), fuel_consumption INT);INSERT INTO container_ships (ship_id, ship_name, ship_builder, year, container_type, fuel_consumption) VALUES (1, 'Ever Golden', 'Imabari Shipbuilding', 2016, 'dry', 230), (2, 'HMM Oslo', 'Hyundai Heavy Industries', 2016, 'refrigerated', 250);\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the minimum fuel consumption of container ships built in 2016, grouped by container type?\n\n        # RESPONSE:\n        SELECT container_type, MIN(fuel_consumption) AS min_fuel_consumption\n        FROM container_ships\n        WHERE year = 2016\n        GROUP BY container_type;\n\n        # EXPLANATION:\n        The query uses the SELECT statement to retrieve the container type and the minimum fuel consumption for container ships built in 2016. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include ships built in 2016. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by container type. The MIN function is used to find the minimum fuel consumption for each container type."
